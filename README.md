## Known Bugs
_Ideally, the sidebar About Me section would be fixed as you slide down. The padding for most of the elements is currently far from ideal. The unordered lists do not line up to center. The photos chosen for thumbnails do not compress to the correct size. The line of code for hovering over thumbnails is not operational. There is a stacking issue between the Thursday and Wednesday panels when collapsing the screen._
